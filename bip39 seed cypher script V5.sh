BIP39 Word Mixer - A tool to encode/decode BIP39 seed phrases

Usage:
    ${script_name} [-f OUTPUT_FILE] [-p PASSWORD] [WORD1 WORD2 ... | SEEDFILE]
    ${script_name} -h | --help

Description:
    This script takes BIP39 seed words and creates a password-protected encoding/decoding
    of those words. The same password will decode the encoded words back to the original.

Parameters:
    -f OUTPUT_FILE    Optional. Save output to specified file (will append .txt if needed)
    -p PASSWORD       Optional. Specify password directly (if not used, will prompt securely)
    -h, --help       Show this help message and exit
    WORDS            Space-separated BIP39 words
    SEEDFILE         Text file containing BIP39 words (one per line)

Examples:
    # Encode/Decode three words and display result (will prompt for password)
    ${script_name} abandon ability able

    # Encode/Decode words with password specified
    ${script_name} -p mypassword abandon ability able

    # Encode/Decode words and save to file
    ${script_name} -f my_encoded_seed abandon ability able

    # Encode/Decode words from file with password
    ${script_name} -p mypassword my_seed_phrase.txt

System Requirements:
    - Bash ${MIN_BASH_VERSION}.0 or higher
    - GNU coreutils (sha256sum)
    - Standard POSIX utilities
    - 100MB available RAM
    - Write permissions in output directory
    - UTF-8 terminal support

Security Notes:
    - The output file permissions are set to ${PERMISSIONS} (user read/write only)
    - When -p is not used, password is read securely without echo
    - Memory is cleared after execution
    - Temporary files are not created
    - Using -p option may expose password in command history and process list
