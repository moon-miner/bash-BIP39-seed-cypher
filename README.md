## üìù Project Description
This script provides a secure way to transform BIP39 seed phrases into alternative valid BIP39 phrases and back, using password-based encryption. It maintains the original security properties of BIP39 while adding an extra layer of protection through reversible transformation.

The transformation is:
- Completely reversible
- Password-dependent
- Statistically uniform
- Maintaining BIP39 format

## üî• Installation Methods (BETA VERSION)

### Method 1: Blockchain Installation (Recommended)
The main script scypher.sh is stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring it will never be lost. To install:

Get the loader script directly from the blockchain:
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.sigmaspace.io/api/v1/tokens/b1715708cdc9c9f42f7de433061711b2ad79814a2e837e6aa9dd9de16b82d9d4 | jq -r '.description' | base64 -d > scypherdload.sh
chmod +x scypherdload.sh
```

Verify the loader script integrity:
```bash
# The MD5 hash of scypherdload.sh should be:
393cd4d53ac3d0316d7d7cf8d40fdcc1
```

Run the loader to retrieve the main script from the blockchain:
```bash
./scypherdload.sh
```

This will:
- Fetch the encoded script pieces from the blockchain
- Automatically decode and decompress them
- Create the scypher.sh file in your current directory
- Clean up any temporary files

The downloader ensures you always get the authentic, unmodified version of the script directly from the blockchain.

### Method 2: Traditional Installation
If you prefer the traditional method:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x scypher.sh
```
3. Verify the script works:
```bash
./scypher.sh --help
```

## üíª Usage

### Requirements
- Bash 4.0 or higher
- Basic POSIX utilities (read, printf, etc.)
- sha256sum command (usually part of coreutils)
- UTF-8 terminal support

### Examples
```bash
# To display the help message and all available options:
./scypher.sh --help
# or
./scypher.sh -h

# Basic interactive usage
./scypher.sh

# Save output to file (interactive mode)
./scypher.sh -f output_file

# Silent mode for script automation
./scypher.sh -s

# Debug mode
./scypher.sh -d
```

### Interactive Flow
1. Run the script
2. Enter seed phrase or input file path
3. Enter and confirm password
4. View results
5. Press enter to clear screen

## üîí Security

### Security Features
- Perfect Shuffle Algorithm: Implements an advanced shuffling mechanism for optimal statistical distribution
- Interactive Input: Secure input method for seed phrases and passwords
- Multiple Input Methods: Support for direct input or reading from files
- Password-Based Transformation: Uses password input to generate unique transformations
- Reversible Operations: Guarantees 100% accuracy in reversing transformations
- BIP39 Compliance: All output remains valid BIP39 words
- Cross-Platform Support: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with bash)
- No External Dependencies: Uses only bash built-ins and core utilities
- Silent Mode: Available for script automation

### Security Strengths
- Statistical Uniformity: Demonstrated through extensive testing
- No Data Leakage: Secure handling of sensitive information
- Memory Safety: Proper cleanup of sensitive data
- Input Validation: Robust error checking and input sanitization
- Deterministic Operation: Same input always produces same output
- No Temporary Files: All operations performed in memory
- Screen Clearing: Sensitive information is cleared from display

### Security Analysis
Extensive testing using our Python Script Analyzer tool has shown:

Distribution Analysis:
- Uniform distribution across all word positions (Chi-square p-values > 0.05)
- No significant word frequency bias (max frequency ~1.5% in 10,000 tests)
- High entropy maintained across all positions

Reversibility Testing:
- 100% success rate in reversibility tests
- Perfect reconstruction of original seed phrases
- No data loss or corruption in transformation process

Test Results Summary:
- Total tests: 10,000
- Success rate: 100%
- Reversibility: 100%
- Chi-square p-values: 0.08-0.99 (all positions)
- Word frequency: Max 1.5% occurrence

### Security Considerations
While this tool has been thoroughly tested and analyzed, users should:
- Keep their passwords secure
- Not share transformed seed phrases
- Maintain secure backups of original seeds
- Test recovery process before use
- Verify script integrity before use

## üõ† Technical Details

### Implementation Notes
- Uses Fisher-Yates shuffle with cryptographic seeding
- Implements perfect shuffle algorithm for optimal distribution
- Employs secure password handling mechanisms
- Includes comprehensive input validation

### Performance
- Linear time complexity O(n) for operations
- Constant memory usage
- No disk I/O beyond initial loading

## Script Analyzer
A Python-based analysis tool is included to verify the statistical properties and security characteristics of the cipher implementation.

### Analyzer Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - tqdm
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - psutil

### Analyzer Installation
Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy tqdm matplotlib seaborn psutil
```

### Analyzer Usage
Basic usage with default settings:

```bash
python script_analyzer.py                  # Run with defaults (English UI, random passwords, high resources)
```

Available options:

```bash
python script_analyzer.py -h               # Show help message with examples
python script_analyzer.py -r 1             # Resource usage (1=low, 2=med, 3=high)
python script_analyzer.py -p random        # Password mode (random/similar)
python script_analyzer.py -l en            # Language (en/es)
python script_analyzer.py -t 1000          # Number of tests
python script_analyzer.py -rv 500          # Number of reversibility tests
python script_analyzer.py -sp "word1 ..."  # Custom seed phrase for testing
```

Example with multiple options:

```bash
# Run 1000 tests with Spanish interface and custom seed phrase
python script_analyzer.py -t 1000 -l es -sp "word1 word2 word3 word4"

# Run analysis with default seed phrase and mid resources
python script_analyzer.py -r 2 -t 5000
```

Note: When using `-sp` (seed phrase), ensure all words are valid BIP39 words.
