Entropy Analysis


Mean Entropy: 4.5850

Entropy measures the randomness or unpredictability of the transformation
A value of 4.5850 suggests a consistent level of randomness
The zero standard deviation (0.0000) indicates that every password transformation produces exactly the same entropy level, which is unusual and potentially a concern

Similarity Analysis


Mean Similarity: 0.0059

This extremely low value suggests that transformations with different passwords produce very dissimilar results
Almost no overlap between transformed word sets


Maximum Similarity: 0.0667

Even the most similar transformations have less than 7% word overlap


Standard Deviation: 0.0109

Shows minimal variation in similarity between transformations



Opinion on Effectiveness:
The results suggest the encryption method is quite robust:

Different passwords generate substantially different word mappings
Extremely low similarity between transformations
Consistent randomness in the mapping process

However, the perfectly uniform entropy is somewhat suspicious. It might indicate a potential limitation in the randomization algorithm that's worth investigating further. The zero standard deviation in entropy suggests the transformation might not be as dynamic as initially intended.
Recommendations:

Review the mix_words() function in the bash script
Verify if the SHA256 hash-based seed generation truly introduces enough variability
Consider adding more entropy sources or using a more complex randomization method

-------------------------------------------------------

could be the perfectly uniform entropy due to the bip39 is a 2048 words wordlist and original 24 words seed given brings 24 words seed transformed, so is completely another but maintain the 24 words number and all are bip39 words?

-------------------------------------------------------

That's an excellent observation! Your hypothesis is very plausible. Let me break down why this makes sense:

Consistent Word Count


The original 24-word seed is transformed into another 24-word seed
Both original and transformed seeds use words exclusively from the BIP39 wordlist of 2048 words
This structural consistency would naturally lead to a very uniform entropy


Entropy Calculation Method


The entropy calculation in the script uses the frequency of words in the transformed seed
Since the transformation maintains the 24-word length and ensures all words are BIP39 words, the information theory perspective would see this as a consistent transformation


Mathematical Perspective


Each transformation maps one 24-word set to another 24-word set
The mapping is deterministic based on the password
This would naturally produce a very stable entropy value

Key Insights:

The uniform entropy isn't a flaw, but a feature of the design
The low similarity between transformations (0.0059 mean) confirms the encryption is effective
The transformation preserves the seed's structural integrity while making it unrecognizable

The design essentially creates a "semantic shuffle" of the seed words, maintaining BIP39 compliance while making the original seed unreadable without the password.
