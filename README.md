# Bash BIP39 Seed Cipher

A secure and efficient tool for encoding and decoding BIP39 seed phrases while maintaining the BIP39 word format.

## üìù Project Description

This script provides a secure way to transform BIP39 seed phrases into alternative valid BIP39 phrases and back, using password-based encryption. It maintains the original security properties of BIP39 while adding an extra layer of protection through reversible transformation.

The transformation is:
* Completely reversible
* Password-dependent
* Statistically uniform
* Maintaining BIP39 format

## ‚ú® Key Features

* Perfect Shuffle Algorithm: Implements an advanced shuffling mechanism for optimal statistical distribution
* Interactive Input: Secure input method for seed phrases and passwords
* Multiple Input Methods: Support for direct input or reading from files
* Password-Based Transformation: Uses password input to generate unique transformations
* Reversible Operations: Guarantees 100% accuracy in reversing transformations
* BIP39 Compliance: All output remains valid BIP39 words
* Cross-Platform Support: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with bash)
* No External Dependencies: Uses only bash built-ins and core utilities
* Silent Mode: Available for script automation

## üîí Security Strengths

* Statistical Uniformity: Demonstrated through extensive testing
* No Data Leakage: Secure handling of sensitive information
* Memory Safety: Proper cleanup of sensitive data
* Input Validation: Robust error checking and input sanitization
* Deterministic Operation: Same input always produces same output
* No Temporary Files: All operations performed in memory
* Screen Clearing: Sensitive information is cleared from display

## üìä Security Analysis

Extensive testing using our Python Script Analyzer tool has shown:

### Distribution Analysis
* Uniform distribution across all word positions (Chi-square p-values > 0.05)
* No significant word frequency bias (max frequency ~1.5% in 10,000 tests)
* High entropy maintained across all positions

### Reversibility Testing
* 100% success rate in reversibility tests
* Perfect reconstruction of original seed phrases
* No data loss or corruption in transformation process

### Test Results Summary
* Total tests: 10,000
* Success rate: 100%
* Reversibility: 100%
* Chi-square p-values: 0.08-0.99 (all positions)
* Word frequency: Max 1.5% occurrence

## üíª Usage Example

```bash
# To display the help message and all available options:
./scypher.sh --help
# or
./scypher.sh -h

# Basic interactive usage
./scypher.sh

# Save output to file (interactive mode)
./scypher.sh -f output_file

# Silent mode for script automation
./scypher.sh -s

# Debug mode
./scypher.sh -d
Interactive Usage Flow
```


Run the script
