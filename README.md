# Bash BIP39 Seed Cipher
A secure and efficient tool for encoding and decoding BIP39 seed phrases while maintaining the BIP39 word format.

## üìù Project Description
This script provides a secure way to transform BIP39 seed phrases into alternative valid BIP39 phrases and back, using password-based encryption. It maintains the original security properties of BIP39 while adding an extra layer of protection through reversible transformation.

The transformation is:

* Completely reversible
* Password-dependent
* Statistically uniform
* Maintaining BIP39 format

## üî• Installation Methods
### Method 1: Blockchain Installation (Recommended)
The main script `scypher.sh` is stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring it will never be lost. To install:

Download the blockchain fetcher script:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moon-miner/bash-BIP39-seed-cypher/refs/heads/main/dlfb.sh
chmod +x dlfb.sh
```

Verify the fetcher script integrity:
```bash
# The MD5 hash of dlfb.sh should be:
f4c99fc63b1b38afc87b3801a2372f79
```

Run the fetcher to retrieve the main script from the blockchain:
```bash
./dlfb.sh
```

This will:
- Fetch the encoded script pieces from the blockchain
- Automatically decode and decompress them
- Create the `scypher.sh` file in your current directory
- Clean up any temporary files

The downloader ensures you always get the authentic, unmodified version of the script directly from the blockchain.

### Method 2: Traditional Installation
If you prefer the traditional method:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x scypher.sh
```
3. Verify the script works:
```bash
./scypher.sh --help
```

## ‚ú® Key Features
* Perfect Shuffle Algorithm: Implements an advanced shuffling mechanism for optimal statistical distribution
* Interactive Input: Secure input method for seed phrases and passwords
* Multiple Input Methods: Support for direct input or reading from files

* No Temporary Files: All operations performed in memory
* Screen Clearing: Sensitive information is cleared from display

## üìä Security Analysis
Extensive testing using our Python Script Analyzer tool has shown:

### Distribution Analysis
* Uniform distribution across all word positions (Chi-square p-values > 0.05)
* No significant word frequency bias (max frequency ~1.5% in 10,000 tests)
* High entropy maintained across all positions

### Reversibility Testing
* 100% success rate in reversibility tests
* Perfect reconstruction of original seed phrases
* No data loss or corruption in transformation process

### Test Results Summary
* Total tests: 10,000
* Success rate: 100%
* Reversibility: 100%
* Chi-square p-values: 0.08-0.99 (all positions)
* Word frequency: Max 1.5% occurrence

## üíª Usage Example
```bash
# To display the help message and all available options:
./scypher.sh --help
# or
./scypher.sh -h

# Basic interactive usage
./scypher.sh

# Save output to file (interactive mode)
./scypher.sh -f output_file

# Silent mode for script automation
./scypher.sh -s

# Debug mode
./scypher.sh -d
```

### Interactive Usage Flow
1. Run the script
2. Enter seed phrase or input file path
3. Enter and confirm password
4. View results
5. Press enter to clear screen

## üìã Requirements
* Bash 4.0 or higher
* Basic POSIX utilities (read, printf, etc.)
* sha256sum command (usually part of coreutils)
* UTF-8 terminal support

* Employs secure password handling mechanisms
* Includes comprehensive input validation

### Performance
* Linear time complexity O(n) for operations
* Constant memory usage
* No disk I/O beyond initial loading
